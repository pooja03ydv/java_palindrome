# **Exam Instructions**
- Students will be provided with a custom role in github's repository where they can write their code in a particular branch alloted to them.

- Students will also have the permission to raise a pull request so they can check there exam results.

- If all the checks on students code are passed then only they will get a access to merge the code with main branch.

- If the checks on students code are failed then they will not get an option of merging pull request. In that case they can edit their code and commit the changes. The checks will be performed on each commit.

- Merging the code with main branch will also specify that all the students test cases are passed and they have successfully cleared their exam.

## Steps for students :-

- Clone the github repo on your local machine and checkout into your alloted branch.

```
    1. git clone <repo URL>
    2. git checkout <branch name>
```

- Edit the code based on the given test cases.

- Commit your code into the repo.
```
    $ git commit -m <message>
```

- Raise a pull request to check whether your test cases are passed. 

- If test cases are failed edit you code again till your test cases get passed.

- Once the test cases get passed, then merge the code with main branch.
